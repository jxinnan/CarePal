Tips to Prevent and Reduce the Risk of Falls
1. Exercise Regularly to Prevent Falls
Regular physical activity will lower the chances of falling.

Engaging in at least 150  300 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity weekly will help increase your endurance. Try to do a mix of physical activity, especially strength, balance and flexibility exercises at least 3 days a week. For example, do exercises such as Tai Chi, Pilates or swimming to strengthen your muscles and improve your balance. On other days that week, do aerobic exercises such as brisk walking, Zumba or cycling to improve your heart health and circulation. You will find that your balance and gait will improve, and reduce the risk of a fall. Regular physical activity will also reduce symptoms of postural hypotension. Try these seven easy exercises!


2. Keep Your Bones Strong
Keep your bones strong with high-calcium milk.

When bones are weak, they tend to break more easily. This is known as osteoporosis. By taking enough calcium-rich foods every day, you can keep your bones strong. These include low-fat high-calcium milk, sardines, and cheese. Getting an adequate dose of vitamin D from sunlight also helps to keep bones healthy.

Vitamin D helps our body absorb calcium from the food we eat. It can be found in eggs, cod liver oil or fatty fish such as tuna, salmon and sardines. The best way to obtain sufficient vitamin D is to take a walk outdoors when the sun is up. 15 to 30 minutes of exposure to sunlight every day is all we need. However, avoid outdoor activities during the hottest period of the day (10:30 am to 3:30 pm).

3. Go for Regular Eye Checks
Get your eyes checked regularly to maintain clear vision.

Get your eyes checked at least once a year to ensure a clear vision. Your doctor will also be able to detect if you are suffering from any eye conditions such as glaucoma or cataracts, or if your spectacles are fitted to a wrong or outdated prescription.

4. Wear Non-slip Shoes
There are shoes for the elderly to prevent falls.

It is important to select footwear that gives you a secure footing on the ground which thus reduces your risk of slipping. Non-slip soles are essential for a good grip. Ensure that your shoes are comfortable and well fitted to prevent injury.


5. Keep Your Home Safer with These Tips
Fall proofing your home is crucial to prevent and reduce the risk of falls.

Making sure your home environment is risk-free reduces chances of falling. Here are some ways to do so:

Arrange your furniture to make clear pathways for walking.
De-clutter your home to prevent tripping or knocking into things. Ensure that all wires are tucked against the walls to prevent tripping over them. Secure them so that they are out of the walkways.
Use non-slip mats, especially in the bathroom and kitchen, to avoid slipping.
Install grab bars in the bathroom or on stairs for additional support.
Avoid wet floors and clean up mess or spills immediately to reduce the chances of falling.
Keep frequently used items where you can easily reach them. For example, in lower shelves or cabinets.
Keep your home well-lit so you can see clearly. Consider adding more lights to dark areas to promote clear vision, such as staircases, or place a lamp beside your bed should you need to visit the bathroom at night.
Ensure that your feet touch the floor when you sit on the edge of your bed. Before standing up, sit upright for a few moments to regulate blood flow.

6. Review Your Medication with Your Doctor
Consult your doctor about the types of medication you are taking.

If you take four or more different types of medication, visit your doctor for a review at least once a year. Some medications might affect your coordination or balance, or cause dizziness, confusion, or sleepiness, which may increase your risk of falling.

Do bring along any other vitamins or supplements you may be taking as they may cause unwanted side effects when taken with your medication. Always consult your doctor before starting on any kind of medication or supplement.

3,osteoporosis,solutions,"Making Your Home Elder-Friendly 
The elderly need an environment where they can move around safely. Modifying your home by removing slippery rugs, installing grab bars, etc. can make your home safer for them, especially after they have returned home from the hospital.

When our loved ones feel safe, they are able to move independently and comfortably. They will also be able to resume their regular routines and activities faster.

To make your home safe, remove potential hazards to prevent accidents and reduce the risks of falling.

Types of Home Modifications
Changes could be simple adjustments or lifestyle changes, or more complicated modifications like the addition of fittings or structural changes to your home. 

Simple adjustments could include:

Addition of grab bars
Use of non-slip mats or application of non-slip treatments on floors of wet and slippery areas, e.g. bathroom and toilet
Removal of rugs and wires on the floor to prevent falls
Moving switches to an accessible level to make switches more accessible especially to those who wheelchair-bound
Highlighting steps and stairs with fluorescent tape for better visibility at night
Moving your loved one to a room on the ground floor of your multi-storey house
More complicated changes include:

Widening of doorways for easier access into rooms especially if your care recipient is wheelchair bound
Installation of ramps
Removal of walls
Getting Help on Home Modifications
An occupational therapist (OT) can help to assess your home, identify potential hazards, and recommend improvements. The OT will assess your home setting, the habits of your care recipient and your resources before making a recommendation.

There are also social service agencies and private organisations that provide home modification services. Use our E-care Service Locator to compile a list of such organisations.

If you stay in an HDB flat, you can consider applying for Enhancement for Active Seniors (EASE) to modify your home.",healthhub.sg,2024-05-20
